MemoryOS Project Transfer Documentation
Project Status & Achievements
Current State: MemoryOS is a fully functional AI-powered personal knowledge management system with complete MVP features working on Supabase PostgreSQL database.

What's Been Built:

✅ Complete full-stack TypeScript application (React + Node.js + Express)
✅ Supabase PostgreSQL database with vector storage for AI embeddings
✅ AI integration via OpenRouter API (GPT-4o for chat, embeddings for search)
✅ Semantic search with vector similarity matching
✅ Chat interface with memory context and citations
✅ CRUD operations for memories with automatic categorization
✅ Modern UI with Shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
✅ Mobile-responsive design with clean, minimal interface
✅ Database schema with enhanced fields (priority, status, source, linkedMemories)
Recent Enhancements:

Enhanced database schema with priority levels, status tracking, source attribution
Fixed chat scrolling issues to keep header navigation visible
Optimized for free-tier compatibility (no Replit paid features)
Successfully migrated from Replit database to external Supabase PostgreSQL
Technical Architecture
Database (Supabase PostgreSQL):

Connection String: postgresql://postgres.ucmclshrcpmylvsphzlx:howtotrainyourpetdragon123987*@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
Tables:
- users (id, email, firstName, lastName, profileImageUrl, timestamps)
- memories (id, userId, title, content, type, tags[], embedding, priority, status, source, linkedMemories[], summary, timestamps)  
- chat_sessions (id, userId, messages[], createdAt)
- searches (id, userId, query, results[], createdAt)
- sessions (sid, sess, expire) # for authentication
Technology Stack:

Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js + Express + Drizzle ORM + TypeScript
Database: Supabase PostgreSQL with vector support
AI: OpenRouter API (cost-effective alternative to OpenAI)
State Management: TanStack Query for server state
Routing: Wouter (lightweight)
Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
Environment Setup for New Replit
1. Required Environment Variables:

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.ucmclshrcpmylvsphzlx:howtotrainyourpetdragon123987*@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

2. Package Dependencies (package.json already configured):

npm install  # All dependencies already in package.json
npm run db:push  # Sync database schema to Supabase
npm run dev  # Start development server

Core Functionality Working
Memory Management:

Create, read, update, delete memories
Automatic AI categorization and keyword extraction
Vector embedding generation for semantic search
Support for ideas, notes, learnings, tasks with priority/status
AI Features:

Semantic search across all memories using vector similarity
Chat interface that references relevant memories in responses
Automatic keyword extraction and content summarization
Contextual AI responses with memory citations
User Interface:

Dual-view layout: Chat interface + Memory list
Modern, clean design with proper mobile responsiveness
Advanced filtering by type, priority, status, date
Modal forms for memory creation/editing
Real-time updates with optimistic UI
Current Challenges & Next Development Phase
Immediate Priorities:

Export/Import Functionality - User wants to download project files for local development
Custom Domain Deployment - Deploy to atharvasingh.com/memoryos for free
Performance Optimizations - Implement advanced filtering, bulk operations
Enhanced AI Features - Better memory linking, relationship detection
Known Issues to Address:

LSP diagnostic in server/services/openai.ts (minor typing issue)
Need to add bulk memory operations (select multiple, batch delete/archive)
Memory relationship visualization not yet implemented
Advanced analytics dashboard pending
Next Stage Development Tasks:

Frontend Enhancements (follow the detailed frontend instructions provided)
Memory Relationship Mapping - Visual network graph of connected memories
Advanced Search - Filters, sorting, pagination for large datasets
Export Features - JSON, CSV, Markdown export options
Deployment Pipeline - Set up for Vercel/Railway deployment
Migration Instructions for New Replit
Step 1: Project Setup

# Import the project files (Git clone or ZIP upload)
# Navigate to project directory
npm install
Step 2: Database Connection

# Add environment variables in Replit Secrets:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.ucmclshrcpmylvsphzlx:howtotrainyourpetdragon123987*@aws-1-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key
# Sync database schema
npm run db:push
Step 3: Verification

# Start development server
npm run dev
# Test endpoints:
# GET /api/auth/user (should return demo user)
# GET /api/memories (should return existing memories)
# GET /api/stats (should show memory counts)
Step 4: Continue Development

All existing memories and data preserved in Supabase
Demo authentication already working (easy to replace with real auth)
Ready for frontend enhancements and deployment preparation
User Context & Preferences
Communication Style: Simple, everyday language (non-technical user)
Priority: Functionality over aesthetics, clean minimal interface
Constraints: Free-tier only, no paid platform dependencies
Goal: Personal knowledge management system that works across platforms
Deployment Target: Custom subdomain (atharvasingh.com/memoryos)
The project is production-ready for personal use and ready for the next development phase focusing on enhanced frontend features and deployment.
