It seems like I don't have any memories stored about your Japan tour at the moment. If you'd like, you can add details about the trip so it's easier to reflect on later. For example, you could include highlights, places you visited, experiences you had, or any special moments. Once you've added this, I'll be able to help you access it whenever you want. Let me know if you need assistance with organizing or categorizing these memories!

Best friend surprised me with matcha cake + handwritten notes. Made me realize small gestures hit harder than big gifts.
